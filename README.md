# NZ Crash Severity Analysis

This project explores the relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and the severity of traffic crashes in New Zealand, using the official CAS dataset.

## Goals

1. Determine if there's a correlation between crash severity and area wealth
2. Test if the result is statistically significant
3. Investigate the influence of speed limits, cyclists, and pedestrians on crash severity

## Key Findings

- Crashes are more severe in less economically privileged regions
- The relationship is statistically significant (very low p-values)
- Higher speed limits and involvement of vulnerable users increase severity odds

## How to Run

Open the `nz_crash_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run all cells.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (optional)
- scikit-learn
- scipy
